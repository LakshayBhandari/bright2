		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2. Plans & Payment terms</b>
			<p>
				By subscribing to a specific membership plan of Bukrent, the member is explicitly agreeing to pay, in advance, the reading fee attached to the plan plus any other applicable fee or tax at the frequency specified by the plan. Any non compliance with the payment terms in spite of 2 reminders will attract a penalty of 10% per payment period of the amount due and may lead to cancellation of membership.

			<b>3. Reading period and reading fee</b>
			<p>
				Bukrent proposes a reasonable reading period with a restriction on the number of books that a member can hold at any point in time. No penalty will be levied for delayed return of books. However, under specific circumstances where other subscribers have requested for and are waiting for a book/s for more than 10 days, Bukrent reserves the right to contact and request members holding book/s to be returned. Reading fees should be paid as per the plan. In the event a member does not renew his/her subscription the company reserves the right to adjust the deposit amount towards the reading fees. All correspondence in this regard will be communicated to the email address of the member as submitted in the application form. Members are requested to update their contact details periodically when changed. Reading fee paid in advance will not be refunded.
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>4. Lost or Damaged books</b>
			<p>
				At Bukrent, we take utmost care to maintain books in good condition. Any anomaly (unprinted pages) of damage if found should be reported either at the front desk while getting the book issued or to the delivery executive if the book is delivered at the door. Failure to check and/or report the same will be constituted as if the member has received a book in good condition. While returning the book, The front desk executive or the deliver executive (if the book is collected at the door) will check for any damage of book(s) and report to the member accordingly. The determination of a book being “damaged” will be at the sole discretion of Bukrent. Members can choose to replace a lost or damaged book within 10 days or pay the penalty amount determined by Bukrent. The damage policy is detailed below.
			</p>
		</p>
		<b>NATURE OF DAMAGE</b>
		<b>
			<p>If the book is lost - Total Cost of the Book</p>
			<p>Scribbling or torn page in Children’s books - Rs.30</p>
			<p>Fine damage or torn pages - 50% cost of the Book</p>
		</b>
		<p>
			<b>6. Unclaimed Refundable Deposit</b>
			<p>
				Upon expiry of membership, Bukrent sends reminders over emails/sms to its members for renewal. Three months after expiry, Bukrent reserves the right to classify the account as ‘Dormant’ and initiate steps to recover cost of books and any unpaid reading fee from the refundable deposit, if there is no action on the reminders, which would be communicated to the member through email/sms. Post this recovery, any excess deposit left in the account will be retained as “Unclaimed '' refundable deposit for a period of 3 months and periodic reminders would be sent to the member to claim the same. After 12 months of expiry of membership, Bukrent reserves the right to treat the member as “not reachable” and take appropriate action on the unclaimed refundable deposit if there has been no response from the member on the reminder communications.
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>7. Definition of a BOOK</b>
			<p>
				Since the reading fee is a flat rate and is not linked to the number of books read in a period, it is important to note that each title catalogued in Bukrent gets the same treatments irrespective of size, cost & target reader. Children’s books are treated the same way as other books.
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>9. Temporary suspension of membership</b>
			<p>
				Through a feature called “Subscription Holiday '', Bukrent allows the member to pause the membership (temporary suspension), for a duration of 1 month, 2 months or 3 months before expiration of membership. During the Subscription Holiday period, a member will not be able to use the library. To utilise this feature, a member is required to fill up the Subscription Holiday Form either at the branch or online. All issued books and magazines should be returned to the Bukrent branch before the start date of Subscription Holiday. Members who pay for Yearly and Half-yearly terms will receive free Subscription Holidays of 2 months and 1 month respectively, and are required to pay Rs. 50/- per month thereafter. Quarterly members are required to pay Rs. 50/- per month to avail the feature.
